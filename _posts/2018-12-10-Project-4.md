By Ben Leskovac

This project focuses mainly around creating the website that you're reading this on, what changes I made, what code I wrote, and what I used to do it all.

This is the what the mainpage of the code looks like:

This website came with a template which already had all of these folders. I edited most of these folders so instead of looking like a template it looked like my website.

I added pictures into my website under the posts section to depict the things I created.
