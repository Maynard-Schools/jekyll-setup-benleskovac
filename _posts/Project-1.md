  The website I’m reviewing is Youtube. Youtube is a website that anyone can upload content to and other people who use Youtube can watch the video. Since its release, in 2005, it’s racked up multiple billion views and about 3 billion hours of video watched every month. That’s 342465.75 years, which is mind-blowing. Obviously, if it’s this popular and only available online, it has to have a good website, and that’s what I’m reviewing today.
 
The homepage of Youtube is constantly changing, if you’re signed in it would recommend different videos for you to watch.
