## About the project

This project is for my high school web design class. It is the fourth project we have done so far, but it is the first one we have done that involved looking and editing code. It is a fairly interesting project and I am glad we did it.


## Work Done

Here is a basic overview of the work that I accomplished in this project:

I edited the 6 files that was required in the project, including adding detail using css, creating a description, adding a header and more. I learned how to add a subpage to a web file and I added one in my project. Finally I learned the basics of what html code and css code look like, as well as the basics of what css templates look like, and how to read and edit them.
